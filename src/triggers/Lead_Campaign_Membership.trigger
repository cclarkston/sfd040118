Created by Chris McDowell on 1/10/2012
Trigger designed to create records in the campaign membership table when leads are updated or inserted.

Modified by CM on 2/1/2012
Trigger has been updated to add leads to a Fielded Leads campaign (based on Type) when the call result
is set to fielded lead.  Also updated the script so it would only run some of the SOQL queries if
certain situations in the code came up.  This was done to lower the SOQL query usage as the TestLeadTrigger script
was getting close to it's limit.

--After Insert
Trigger should try and match the Marketing_Source__c field against the campaign.phone_number field and look for 
a match where the status is In Progress (or active is true).  If it finds a match,  it should generate the
appropraite record in the campaign members table.  If no match is found,  the campaign id for the unknown bucket
campaign will be used instead and that record will be generated in the campaign members table

Modified by CM on 4/25/2012
Converted Phone numbers to uppercase for storing in the key field of the map and comparing to the key
field of the map.  We had an issue where campaigns with text based phone numbers ccwebsite were not matching
up due to case differences (ex : ccWebsite, ccwebsite, CCWebsite, CCwebsite).  This should be resolved going
forward. 

Modified by CM on 6/27/2013
Added in some code to tie leads to the loyalty campaign when the referred by patient option is checked
